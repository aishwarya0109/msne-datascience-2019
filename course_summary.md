- operators: `+, -, /, *, **, %`
- methods associated with data types, e.g., essential string methods, essential list methods. 
- if-elif-else statements, conditional variable assignment, `in` operator
- list and tuple indexing, dict indexing, mutability vs. immutability, 
- `while` loops, `for` loops, concept of iterator and generator, using `enumerate`,  and `zip`, combining them.
